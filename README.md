# 👋 Hi, I'm Vivek — AI/ML Engineer & Generative AI Enthusiast

🎓 **2023 IT Graduate | Specializing in Prompt Engineering & Generative AI**

After preparing for GATE, I discovered my true passion lies not just in *coding*, but in *creating intelligent systems* that bring ideas to life. I am driven by the fusion of logic and imagination.

💼 Trained in **Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence** at **Krutanic Solutions** under the mentorship of **Ashish Mishra Sir**. My focus now is on mastering **Prompt Engineering** and building impactful projects with **Generative AI**.
